A test app to work out object positioning on a responsive image background.
I am trying to emulate a hidden object game where an object is placed on a background and can be clicked to hide.
The main challenge I want to tackle is to keep the placed object in the same position on the background regardless of screen size etc...
I have not been able to find a solution anywhere so I decided to find my own. 
Because I need this functionality in an app I am working on.
Wish me luck.
